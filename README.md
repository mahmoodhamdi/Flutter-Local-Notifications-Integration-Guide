## 🚀 Getting Started

Integrating local notifications into your Flutter project is easy! Follow the steps below to get started.

### 1. Add the flutter_local_notifications Package

Add the package to your **pubspec.yaml** file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_local_notifications: latest_version
```

Install the package by running:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Android Configuration

#### Add Permissions

Edit your **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml** file to include the necessary permissions:

**Note:** Add these permissions above the `<application>` tag.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM"/>
<!-- Other permissions if necessary -->
```

- `android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`: Ensures notifications are rescheduled after device reboot.
- `android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`: Allows for precise alarm scheduling.

#### Add Receivers

Insert the following receivers before the end of the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<meta-data android:name="flutterEmbedding" android:value="2" />
<receiver android:exported="false" android:name="com.dexterous.flutterlocalnotifications.ScheduledNotificationReceiver" />
<receiver android:exported="false" android:name="com.dexterous.flutterlocalnotifications.ScheduledNotificationBootReceiver">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED"/>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.QUICKBOOT_POWERON"/>
        <action android:name="com.htc.intent.action.QUICKBOOT_POWERON"/>
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

### 3. Gradle Setup

For scheduled notifications to be compatible with older Android versions, you need to enable **desugaring**. Update your application's Gradle file `android/app/build.gradle` as follows:

```gradle
android {
  defaultConfig {
    multiDexEnabled true
  }

  compileOptions {
    coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }
}

dependencies {
  coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.2.2'
}
```

Make sure your project is using **Android Gradle Plugin 7.3.1 or higher**.

If your Flutter app crashes on Android 12L or later when desugaring is enabled, you may need to add the following dependencies:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.window:window:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.window:window-java:1.0.0'
}
```

Additionally, ensure your `compileSdk` is set to at least 34 in your Gradle configuration:

```gradle
android {
    compileSdk 34
}
```

### 4. Custom Notification Sound Setup

You can now customize notification sounds with this setup.

#### Add Sound File

Add your custom notification sound file to the following locations in your project:

- **Flutter assets**: Place your sound file in `assets/audio/`
- **Android raw resources**: Add your sound file to `android/app/src/main/res/raw/`

Ensure that the sound file follows these conditions:

- File format: `.mp3`
- File name: Use lowercase letters and underscores (e.g., `yaamsallyallaelnaby.mp3`).

#### Update `pubspec.yaml`

Configure the sound asset in your `pubspec.yaml` file under the `assets` section:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/audio/
```

#### Custom Sound Notification

The custom sound feature is already integrated into the notification helper function. By default, the notification will play the custom sound file `yaamsallyallaelnaby.mp3`. You can specify the sound file or let it use the default one as follows:

```dart
NotificationHelper.showBasicNotification(
  id: Random().nextInt(1 << 32),
  title: "Custom Sound Notification",
  body: "This notification has a custom sound!",
  sound: RawResourceAndroidNotificationSound('yaamsallyallaelnaby'),
);
```

If no sound is provided, the default sound (`yaamsallyallaelnaby.mp3`) will be used.
